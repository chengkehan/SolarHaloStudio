I'd like to add raindrop effect on windows to my game. In a rainy scene, player look through the window, raindrop flow down. This will get some interesting experiences.<!--more-->

So I learned several tutorials. [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) is a good reference, I can find some fantastic effects, but that's not exactly what I need. I have to understand concepts under the hood and write code according to my own requirement.

The code of ShaderToy is hard to understand even though I tried so hard. At this time, another site helped me a lot. [The Art of Code](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheArtofCodeIsCool) is a great tutorial. This author teach us basic concepts step by step. I think everyone can get a lot from his channel.

Finally, I get my own raindrop. There's still a lot of things for improvement, I will do it later. And also I will optimize the performance.
