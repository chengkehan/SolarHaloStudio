When water drop down through glass, this will cause a disturbance of our sight, because of surface is not flat any more. Of course the change in density is also need to consider, but we are not doing academic research, so ignore this point.<!--more-->

And on a fogged glass, lots of tiny water droplets are evenly distributed on the surface. Raindrop flowing down will break this status. A phenomenon we see is a long tail behind a raindrop.

If you have watched my previous video, I didn't implemnt this. So I will add this feature to my raindrop effect.  Tails of raindrop will distort images and leave tracks.
