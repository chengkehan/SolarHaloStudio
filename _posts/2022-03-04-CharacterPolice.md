Profile: 
- When he was young, he was also personable, not only handsome, but also very good at handling cases. I heard that some people think that this young man is too good for him. During a police call, he was seriously injured. After his recovery, he will no longer have the same good look as before, but he is still the most responsible and trustworthy person in the police station.<!--more-->
