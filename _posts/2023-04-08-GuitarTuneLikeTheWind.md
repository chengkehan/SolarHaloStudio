"Like the Wind" is composed by S.E.N.S, I like this music very much. I think it's so suitable for a effect on ShaderToy when the first time I saw it. The shader effect named "The Drive Home". So I used this shader as foreground and record a playing guitar video as background. Hope you also like it.<!--more-->
