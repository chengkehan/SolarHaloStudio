www subdomains
A www subdomain is the most commonly used type of subdomain. For example, www.example.com includes a www subdomain.

www subdomains are the most stable type of custom domain because www subdomains are not affected by changes to the IP addresses of GitHub's servers.

Custom subdomains
A custom subdomain is a type of subdomain that doesn't use the standard www variant. Custom subdomains are mostly used when you want two distinct sections of your site. For example, you can create a site called blog.example.com and customize that section independently from www.example.com.
