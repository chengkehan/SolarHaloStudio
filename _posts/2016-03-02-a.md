You can set up either or both of apex and www subdomain configurations for your site. For more information on apex domains, see "Using an apex domain for your GitHub Pages site."

We recommend always using a www subdomain, even if you also use an apex domain. When you create a new site with an apex domain, we automatically attempt to secure the www subdomain for use when serving your site's content. If you configure a www subdomain, we automatically attempt to secure the associated apex domain. For more information, see "Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site."

After you configure a custom domain for a user or organization site, the custom domain will replace the <user>.github.io or <organization>.github.io portion of the URL for any project sites owned by the account that do not have a custom domain configured. For example, if the custom domain for your user site is www.octocat.com, and you have a project site with no custom domain configured that is published from a repository called octo-project, the GitHub Pages site for that repository will be available at www.octocat.com/octo-project.
